## About
I'm a sophomore mechanical engineering student at CPP working on Formula SAE powertrain controls. I lead design work for the clutch & shifter subsystems, focusing on **full CAD design, sizing, manufacturability, and integration** across the yearly design cycle. Current R&D: an **electronic clutch system** with programmable actuation.

- GPA: **3.53**
- Interests: CAD, 3D printing, PCB design, RC planes, drones
- Looking for: **Mechanical/Design/Manufacturing internships**
