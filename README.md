# Portfolio Site (GitHub Pages)

**How to publish (5 minutes):**
1. Create a new GitHub repository named **<your-username>.github.io** (public).
2. Upload all files from this folder into the repo (drag-and-drop in the browser works).
3. Commit the changes.
4. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and confirm the site is deploying from the **main** branch, **/(root)**.  
5. Your site will be at **https://<your-username>.github.io** once the build finishes.

Edit `index.md` and the files in `projects/` to add your content and images. Place images in `assets/images/` and reference them as `/assets/images/your-file.jpg`.
