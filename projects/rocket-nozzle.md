# Liquid Rocket Club (Condensed)

**Focus:** Converging–diverging nozzle for **RP‑1/LOX** using **NASA CEA** and SolidWorks flow simulations.

## Summary
- Performed expansion ratio and performance calculations; created CAD and ran preliminary CFD.  
- Contributed to radial inflow turbine sizing analysis (nitrogen properties, pressure ratios, NsDs charts).  
- Departed the project early — included here for context on propulsion analysis experience.

_Add one nozzle render and one CFD plot if available._
