# Pneumatic Shifter/Clutch Calculator

**Goal:** Determine the appropriate pneumatic cylinder and tank size to achieve target actuation performance **with a safety factor**, minimizing mass and package volume.

## Highlights
- Modeled force, pressure, and volume relationships to set cylinder bore/stroke and tank size.  
- Considered duty cycle, regulator settings, line losses, and response time targets.  
- Delivered a simple tool to guide **component selection** and communicate tradeoffs with the team.
