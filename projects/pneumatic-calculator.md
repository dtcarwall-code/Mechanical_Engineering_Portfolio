# Arduino + Custom PCB (Simon Says)

**Stack:** KiCad (schematic/PCB), Arduino (C++), LCD, buttons, 3D-printed enclosure.

## What I Built
- Designed a **custom PCB** in KiCad to integrate with an Arduino microcontroller.  
- Programmed game logic, LED control, button debouncing, and LCD I/O in **C++**.  
- Printed a durable **enclosure** and mounted components for a finished device.

_Add figures or screenshots here._
