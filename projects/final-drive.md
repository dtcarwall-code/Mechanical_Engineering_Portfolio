# Final Drive Ratio Optimization (OptimumLap)

**Context:** Formula SAE drivetrain selection for the **Michigan** endurance track.

## Approach
- Matched simulation parameters to real-world constraints (engine map, mass, aero, rolling resistance).  
- Analyzed lap times and segment speeds **with/without first gear**; assessed acceleration vs. top speed tradeoffs.  
- Recommended final drive ratio that improves average lap time without compromising drivability.
