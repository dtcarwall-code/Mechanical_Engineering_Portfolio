# Formula SAE — Clutch & Shifter (Captain)

**Team:** Cal Poly Pomona Formula SAE  
**Role:** Clutch & Shifter Captain (2024–Present)

## Overview
Formula SAE is a full **yearly engineering design cycle**: requirements → concept → **CAD** → analysis → **manufacturing** → integration → testing → competition. Subsystems must meet performance, reliability, cost, and rules constraints under tight deadlines and cross-team coordination.

## Responsibilities & Scope
- Lead design for clutch & shifter subsystems with **full CAD ownership**, component sizing, and manufacturability considerations.  
- Collaborate with powertrain, electronics, and driver controls to ensure **system integration** and serviceability.  
- Mentor interns/new members on CAD workflows and subsystem tasks; run short design reviews and documentation.

## Electronic Clutch System (R&D)
- Architecture with **discrete positions** (engaged, bite point, disengaged) and **adjustable actuation timing**.  
- Early-stage analysis: actuator selection, force/pressure requirements, sensor strategy, safety interlocks.  
- Goal: improve **launch consistency**, driver feel, and repeatability for endurance and autocross events.

## Pneumatic Shifter/Clutch Calculator
- Built a calculator for **cylinder & tank sizing** to meet response and durability targets with a defined safety factor.  
- Outcome: improved confidence in pneumatic component selection and understanding of **fluid power** tradeoffs.

## Final Drive Ratio Optimization (OptimumLap)
- Simulated the **Michigan endurance** track; compared gearing including scenarios without first gear.  
- Delivered data-backed recommendations for final drive selection to balance acceleration and top speed.

## Team & Competition
- Used **Git-based collaboration**, BOM/version control, and manufacturing drawings to hand off to fab.  
- Preparing for **FSAE Michigan 2025**; deliverables cover design documentation, tech inspection readiness, and on-track testing.
